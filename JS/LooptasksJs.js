var endnum=parseInt(prompt("Enter the final value"))
var sum =0;

            sum+=i;
        }
        alert("The sum of the incoming numbers: "+sum)

//2. Determine the number of digits in the entered number
/*var num=parseInt(prompt("Enter the number"))
var sum =0;
if(!isNaN(num)){
    for (var i= num;i>0;i--){
        sum+=1;

}*/





//3. The game "Guess the number." Ask the user to think of a number from 0 to 100 and guess it in the following way: each iteration, divide the range of numbers by half, write the result in N and ask the user "Is this your number > N, <N or == N?". Depending on what the user indicates, reduce the range. The initial range from
//0 to 100 is divided by half and you get 50. If the user indicates that their number is > 50, then change the range from 51 to 100. And so on until the user chooses == N
