//3. Ask the user 3 questions, each question has 3 answers. For each correct answer, 2 points are awarded. After the questions are over, output the number of scored points.

/*var totalbal=0;

}
var question3 = prompt("Question 2: What is 2 + 2?\n1. 3\n2. 4\n3. 5");
if(question3==="3"){
    totalbal+=2;
}
alert("Your total score is: " + totalbal);*/

//4. Ask the user for a year and check whether it is a leap year or not. A leap year is either a multiple of 400 or 4, and not a multiple of 100

/*var yearpr=prompt("Hello, please enter the year. for example 1600");
